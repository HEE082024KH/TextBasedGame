## Text Based Game

After looking for a project to work on, I finally felt like I had enough knowledge to get started.
Since I love video games I thought it would be fun to create my own. With my limited knowledge
I decided to create a text based game.

Initially the idea was to create a simple game, but as I've worked on it new ideas has come up and
the project grew in size.

Currently, the game only has 2/12 locations finished, but most game logic and structure is done.
**\*About 15% done overall.**

Feel free to test the game if you want, any feedback is welcome.

Working on this project I have gotten better at:

- Splitting up project in different files
- Switches and if/else loops, conditionals
- General game logic
- Labels and project structure
